	o SOAR v0.99-3.  Changes to V0.99-2:
	  - minor coding change to the Data and Utils variants to
	    correct a potential enigma with their operation.
	    Invisible to the user.

	  - The function Search now has an argument, 'abbrev', which
	    allows the user to lop off the leading section of long
	    lib.loc names.  The default is not to lop.  See help file
	    for more details.
	    
	  - Many changes, extensions and clarifications in the
	    vignette.  The most important change is a new sub-section
	    on "Windows and other traps" drawing attention to a
	    potential problem with SOAR on Windows filesystems caused
	    by file-name case insensitivity.  As the problem is not
	    exclusively confined to the Windows operating system, all
	    users are urged to read and take in this section before
	    proceeding to use the package.

	o SOAR v0.99-2 released on CRAn on 2001-04-07. This corrected
	  a potentially serious bug (on Windows alone) and required a
	  change to the encoding scheme.  Caches created either with
	  ASOR or with SOAR v0.99-1 are automatically converted to
	  meet the new file name encoding scheme

	o SOAR v0.99-1 released on CRAN on 2010-04-06. When used with
	  caches created with the unofficial pre-release 'ASOR'
	  package, these caches are (permanently) changed to meet the
	  new file name encoding scheme of SOAR
